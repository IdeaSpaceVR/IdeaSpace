## About IdeaSpaceVR 

### Content Management System
Manage your virtual reality spaces and assets like you would manage blog posts. Run it on your own server. All you need is PHP and a database (eg. MySQL, MariaDB).

### VR Themes
Download and install new themes and create a virtual reality website. Or create your own theme with the Theme API. [Take a look at our theme directory](https://www.ideaspacevr.org/themes), there might not be many themes yet, but it is constantly growing.

### Based on WebVR Standard
IdeaSpaceVR is using WebVR for interactive VR experiences that is compatible with all modern web browsers on PC and mobile. Therefore... we love [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe)!

### Mission
<em>"We believe that everyone should be able to easily create and publish virtual reality web experiences with the focus on content creation and creativity. Software developers should have the possibility to create and share virtual reality web themes."</em>
